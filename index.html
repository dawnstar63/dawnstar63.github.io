    <p>Hi there! Welcome to my website!</p>

    <p>A bit about myself: I'm a cellist and coder currently studying at the Columbia-Juilliard Exchange program. I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, and was a student at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music Pre-College Division and a member of the San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra until 2016.</p>
