    <p>Hi there, welcome to my website!</p>

    <p>A bit about myself: I'm a cellist and coder currently pursuing an Artist Diploma at The Juilliard School. Previously, I received my Masters in Music from Juilliard and a Bachelors in Computer Science at Columbia University, as part of <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/eye/2016/09/19/barnard-columbia-juilliard-effect/" target="_blank">their exchange program</a>. I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, and was a student at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music Pre-College Division and a member of the San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra.</p>

    <p>As of fall 2021, I am giving this website a much-needed overhaul â€“ many more pages are in the works, but feel free to browse around!</p>
