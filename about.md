While an undergrad at Columbia, she performed the Dvorak Concerto with the Columbia University Orchestra, under the direction of Jeffrey Milarsky. In 2018, she gave a world premiere performance of composer Hiroya Miura’s Lustral Shades, collaborating with esteemed musicians of the Japanese tradition. In 2017, she was invited to perform as part of the New World Symphony on one of its season concerts, under the baton of Michael Tilson Thomas. Featured on NPR’s From the Top in 2015, Elena also performed as a soloist at Davies Symphony Hall with the San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra in the same year.

In 2011, Elena helped raise more than $12,000 through three charity concerts that she and her friends organized in the San Francisco Bay Area, in order to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Since then, she has performed in several concerts to benefit the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Japanese Red Cross, Global Giving, and the Transparent Fish Fund. In her spare time, she enjoys paper crafting and playing chamber music with her violinist brother and her mother, a pianist.
